# Speaking-Echo-Pulse-Radar-
An Ultrasonic Radar System built with Arduino, SRF05 ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, DFPlayer Mini, joystick, and 7-segment display, with real-time visualization in Processing. The project scans a 180° field, detects objects, measures distance, plays distance-based audio feedback, and visualizes results as a radar interface on the computer.
