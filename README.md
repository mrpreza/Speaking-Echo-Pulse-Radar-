# Speaking-Echo-Pulse-Radar-
An Ultrasonic Radar System built with Arduino, SRF05 ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, DFPlayer Mini, joystick, and 7-segment display, with real-time visualization in Processing. The project scans a 180° field, detects objects, measures distance, plays distance-based audio feedback, and visualizes results as a radar interface on the computer.
Features:

#180° radar scanning with a servo-mounted ultrasonic sensor

#Object detection and distance measurement (up to 200 cm)

#Real-time visualization with Processing (radar sweep + red object markers)

#Countdown timer on 7-segment display before radar activation

#Audio feedback with DFPlayer Mini (distance-based sound files)

#Pause/Resume control using joystick

#Object count tracking and distance display
